This repository includes the Purple Team's data science project, part of Accenture's 6-week programme, ["Women in Data Science Accelerator"](https://www.accenture.com/ie-en/careers/women-in-data-science?src=SOMS).

<b>1. Purpose of the project</b>
  - it implied conducting a root cause analysis as a Proof of Concept for a defect detection model;
  - it uses production data of a multinational Manufacturing Company, experiencing high defect rates.
  
<b>2. Organization and tasks division</b>
  - During the first week of programme, I created a google docs file, accessible to editing to everybody in the team, in which I 
  - My individual tasks inside the team included the profilling/cleaning and modelling of the data.

<b>3. Data profilling</b>
  - I used different software to get a better understanding of the data:
          * [Tableau](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/Plots%20and%20observations) (e.g. highlight tables)
          * [R](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/tree/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/multinomial%20regression) (multinomial regression)
          * [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/Data_cleaning.ipynb) (pandas and numpy to remove duplicates, impute missing values, remove redundant data columns/variables);
     
<b>4. Data modelling</b>  
    - an example of <b>Decision Tree</b> model application;
    - I used [R](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/features_selection.R) (features' selection using RPART), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/Modelling.ipynb) (for features' selection process using Boruta and decision tree model tuning) and [Pycharm](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/export_tree.py) (to export the decision tree using [Graphviz](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/tables%20and%20graphs/tree_exported.svg) and and [dtreeviz](https://github.com/RalucaN/Data-projects/blob/master/Women_in_Data_Science_programme_(Feb%202020-)/tables%20and%20graphs/DTreeViz_11748.svg))
