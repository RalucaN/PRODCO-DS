# Women in Data Science 2020
This folder contains the orginal files and folders of the 2020 project, for Purple Team's data science project, part of Accenture's 6-week programme, "Women in Data Science Accelerator".

## Purpose of the project
  - Conducting a root cause analysis as a Proof of Concept for a defect detection model;
  - Uses production data of a multinational Manufacturing Company, experiencing high defect rates.
  
## Stages of project
  Week 1 - Overview and task distributions <br>
  Week 2 - Exploration and data cleaning <br>
  Week 3 - Feature engineering, and model selection <br>
  Week 4 - Exporting results and validation <br>
  Week 5 - Finalizing the project: reviewing the results and preparing the presentation <br>
  Week 6 - Team Presentation <br>
  
## Software
  - **EDA/data wrangling**<br>
    Tableau (e.g. highlight tables)<br>
    Python/Jupyter (pandas and numpy to remove duplicates, impute missing values, remove redundant data columns/variables) <br>
  - **Feature engineering and modelling** <br>
    R (feature selection using RPART and multinomial regression) <br>
    Jupyter (features selection using Boruta and decision tree model tuning) <br>
